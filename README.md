# 🧠 DSA Mastery in C/C++

This repository contains my journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **C and C++**. It includes well-organized code for core concepts, implementations, and problems from various online platforms.

## 📚 Contents

- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, DP, etc.)
- Problem Solutions (LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG, etc.)
- Notes and Pattern-based Solutions

## 🛠️ Languages

- C
- C++

## 📌 Goal

To build a strong foundation in DSA through code, patterns, and practice.
